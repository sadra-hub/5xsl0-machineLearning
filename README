## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to the following resources and individuals who have been instrumental in the completion of this assignment:

- **Course Resources (5XSL0)**: The resources available on the Canvas platform for the 5XSL0 course provided invaluable guidance and foundational knowledge for understanding the mathematical and algorithmic concepts required for this assignment.

- **ChatGPT**: I utilized ChatGPT for assistance in understanding and refining various coding concepts, implementing algorithms, and improving the clarity of the project.

- **Virginia Vassilevska Williams (Stanford University)**: I am deeply grateful for the insightful work presented in the paper *"Matrix Multiplication via Strassenâ€™s Algorithm"* by Virginia Vassilevska Williams, which inspired and influenced the understanding of optimization and algorithm design for this project. The paper can be found [here](https://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi/matrixmult-f.pdf).

Thank you to all the mentioned sources for their support and contributions to the development of this project.
