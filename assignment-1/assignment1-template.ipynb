    "## Part 3: Linear classification problems\n",
    "In the linear regression problems that we discussed above the goal was to map some input in $\\mathbb{R}^M$ to some output in $\\mathbb{R}$. Ofcourse this output can also be multidimensional. In linear classification problems the goal is not to map some input to a continuous output, but to map some input into a set of classes. In this assignment we will focus on the case where we have 2 classes. This is also known as a binary or logistic regression problem. For the binary classification task we have some (multidimensional) input data $X$, similarly defined as in the regression problem, and some output ${\\boldsymbol{y}}$, where each of the output $y_n \\in \\{0, 1\\}$. The output value is also known as the label and indicates to which group or cluster a certain point belongs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear regression model that we used in Part 2 is not directly suited for these classifications tasks as its output is located in the entire real set. In order to transform this output to an approximation of the set $\\{0, 1\\}$, we need to transform the original output by some non-linear function. A commonly chosen function is the so-called sigmoid function $\\sigma(x)$ which maps the entire real axis to the domain $(0, 1)$. This sigmoid function is defined as \n",
    "$$ \\sigma(x) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} .$$\n",

    "Here $z_n={\\boldsymbol{x}}_n^\\top \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ is an intermediate variable obtained at the output of the original linear model that we had for the linear regression problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through optimization the predicted classes will approximate the true classes as good as possible. The linear model will affinely transform the input data to the real axis with the goal of making the transformed data separable by the sigmoid function. For logistic regression our optimization goal is no longer the mean squared error, but instead we would like to minimize the binary cross-entropy. This cost function is more appropriate as it models the output data as binomial random variables and calculates a probabilistic degree of dissimilarity between the predictions and the true labels. The binary cross-entropy function is defined as \n",
